The Jobs to be done (JTBD) theory has been very well documented. I'll just write few points and will point to the excellent resources available on this topic. I just want to highlight that JTBD is the working philosophy of Firgun Consulting.

The basic constructs of JTBD is captured by these two quotes:

Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt said, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”

Clayton Christensen says, “People buy products and services to get a job done”.

Jobs-to-be-Done Theory provides a framework for defining, categorizing, capturing, and organizing all your customers’ needs. Firgun Consulting uses this framework exactly for that purpose and address out customers' needs.

As Anthony Ulwick, author of the book Jobs to be done, says, the primary cause of failed products and services is a misalignment with customer needs. Using this needs framework, product teams and consultants can deeply understand the jobs its customers are trying to get done and the metrics they use to measure success.
